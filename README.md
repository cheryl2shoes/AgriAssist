# AgriAssist

Use video or picture analysis to identify problems within farming conditions of small scale
farmers or gardeners in the township or rural areas to be able to have high yields whether for
selling or to support themselves at home sufficiently.
The most common problems in agriculture are
    ● Soil erosion
    ● Plant Diseases
    ● Differentiating between beneficial and destructive plant species
    ● Livestock diseases
    ● Proper measurements spaces for plants
    ● Lack of knowledge of seasons and types of biome conditions different plants thrive in
    ● Bad Farming practices for soil preparation and changing of seasons

    
How we will use video and plant analysis to counter problems
    ● Use a model trained to identify between different soil types
    ● Use a model trained to identify different livestock diseases based on the pictures
    provided by our farmer
    ● Identify the insects they in their gardens and weather they are beneficial to their specific
    crops or not
    ● Use a modelSee if the measurements between the different crops and correct to yield
    better crop results

    
After identifying these problems our application will use the results to offer specially curated
solution which they will have to subscribe to our application to see and tutorials.
